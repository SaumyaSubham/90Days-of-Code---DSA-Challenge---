# Path Sum III                                           Difficulty = Medium

# Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.

# The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: 3

        # recursive to get result

        # calculate currPathSum and required oldPathSum
        currPathSum += root.val
        oldPathSum = currPathSum - target
        # update result and cache
        self.result += cache.get(oldPathSum, 0)
        cache[currPathSum] = cache.get(currPathSum, 0) + 1
        
        # dfs breakdown
