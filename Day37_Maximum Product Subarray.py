# Maximum Product Subarray                            Difficulty = Easy

# Given an integer array nums, find a 
# subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

# The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.


class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curMax, curMin = 1, 1
        res = nums[0]
        
        for n in nums:
            vals = (n, n * curMax, n * curMin)
            curMax, curMin = max(vals), min(vals)
			
            res = max(res, curMax)
            
        return res
